# Tareqi

Tareqi is a career guidance prototype designed to help individuals explore IT career paths based on their interests and preferences. Users answer a series of questions, and the app generates a customized roadmap with resources, mental health insights, and side hustle/job opportunities. While this is a fast prototype, our vision is to expand it into a comprehensive career guidance tool.
